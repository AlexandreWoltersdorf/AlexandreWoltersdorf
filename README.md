### Hi there, I'm Alexandre 👋

**AEC Software Engineer & Simulation Specialist** based in Luxembourg/France.
I bridge the gap between **Structural Engineering** and **Modern Software Architecture** to build scalable, carbon-negative construction systems.

---

### 🔭 Current Focus
Leading computational engineering at **LEKO**, developing Python-based pipelines for automated timber manufacturing and structural analysis.

> **⚠️ Note on GitHub Activity:**
> Most of my daily contributions take place in private organization repositories.
> The repositories below represent my personal R&D experiments and portfolio projects.
